# Weather Dashboard

## Description and Requirements

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. This week's challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
<!-- Done -->

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
<!-- Done -->

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
<!-- Done -->

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
<!-- Done -->

```
